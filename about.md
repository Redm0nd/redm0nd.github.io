Hi, I'm Dylan Redmond.

I'm a `Senior DevOps Engineer` based in Dublin, Ireland. I work at <a href="https://www.toasttab.com/" target="_blank">Toast</a>.

I studied Electronic and Computer Engineering at <a href="https://www.dcu.ie/" target="_blank">Dublin City University</a>.


Before Toast, I worked at <a href="https://www.workhuman.com/" target="_blank">Workhuman</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">AWS</a> & <a href="https://www.paddypowerbetfair.com" target="_blank">Paddy Power Betfair</a>.

At Workhuman I was a Senior Cloud Infrastructure Engineer responsible for managing and scaling our AWS infrastructure and building Terraform modules for engineering teams to deploy their services on top of.

I joined AWS in May 2020 as a Cloud Support Engineer in Dublin. In this role, I was responsible for supporting our Deployment, IaC and CICD tooling for our largest Enterprise customers. Became a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/" target="_blank">CloudFormation</a> SME and interviewed 000's of candidates.

I joined PPB in January 2017 as a Football Exchange Operator on a part-time basis.
In this role I was responsible for managing the in-play <a href="https://www.betfair.com/exchange/plus/football" target="_blank">Exchange</a> markets for the highest profile matches across world football.

In September 2018, I moved into Cloud Automation with PPB. Working in a team based across four locations; Dublin, Cluj, London and Porto.

We were responsible for provisioning all of our cloud infrastructure, developing our framework and making it easy for our developers to deploy to production through CI/CD processes. (Across multiple DC's on both Openstack and AWS)
